# Employee-Payrool-Tracking
The purpose of this webpage is to accurately track employees by name and salary by alphebetically organizing them by last name. Originally, there were several missing components and bugs in the JavaScript portion of the code, I added new code and repiared the broken areas to make the webpage function smoothly and effectively. 

When names are inputed onto the prompt, the code automatically sorts them in ascending alphebetical order, and the average salary is displayed in the console for all values entered.
